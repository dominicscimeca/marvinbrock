        The family was hit with another life changing event when Mom newly pregnant had an accidental fall in the first
        trimester of her pregnancy. In order to go to term doctors advised her to have total bed rest for the next six
        months. Marvin had to care for the three girls and his pregnant wife during this time to save the baby.
        Approximately two months after their son was born doctors determined the young child was failing to thrive.
        Tests showed that he had an abnormality of his aorta and required immediate heart surgery to save his life.
        Another major shock reverberated through the Brock family in Canada when Marvin was told the little one was not
        covered under their group health plan with Colonial Insurance company.</p>
    <p> His six month old baby needed heart surgery immediately or would die within about two weeks doctors at British
        Columbia Children’s Hospital told Marvin and his wife Claire. A flurry of activity to save his little boy ensued
        and Marvin was able to secure BCMed a provincial health plan for his family. It covered the cost of the baby’s
        heart surgery. A year later with no resolution over the relationship with Colonial and earned income, Claire and
        children relocated to New England for security as neither Mom or Dad could work in Canada. They watched as
        business income began to quickly shrink as Colonial management offered Brock’s clients a premium discount if
        they switched to Colonial directly.</p>

        Less than a year later, Marvin and Claire were told by doctors at Harvard’s Boston Children’s Hospital that
        their little baby’s spine was curving at two degrees, a month and there was nothing that could be done for him.
        Marvin a long time martial artist told the doctor he had seen Chinese martial artists perform inexplicable feats
        and if British Columbia Children’s, Dartmouth and Boston Children’s couldn’t save his son, he would try the
        Chinese. Marvin and baby spent the next two months driving all across Canada and the western U.S. in search of a
        way to save his baby boy. After a further expedition of a few months in search of a solution, Marvin and Mihdi
        found Dr. Baolin Wu. Dr. Wu had written a book “Lighting the Eye of The Dragon”, which a friend and school mate
        of Marvin’s discovered in a bookstore in B.C.</p>
    <p>
        Father and son had raised the funds to go to Beijing, China to secure the help of Monks and doctors of the White
        Cloud Monastery. Raven Cloudwalker told Marvin that the author and former monk of the monastery was practicing
        medicine in Santa Monica, near Los Angeles, California. Marvin arranged to layover in Los Angeles in order to
        get the former monk to write out directions to the taxi driver in Beijing to take them to the monastery. The
        father and son never did get back on that Northwest flight to China.</p>
    <p>
        Little Mihdi couldn’t walk or talk November 18, 2000 when he and Dad first arrived at the Beijing Chinese
        Medical Center. It was in Oakland California, a couple of months earlier when Mihdi and his father saw the Dalai
        Lama’s physician Dr. Yechi Dhonden that little Mihdi took what some would consider a miraculous change. The
        little baby boy who was like a wet noodle in the crook of his father’s arm for months, as they drove across
        North America in search of a way to save the baby’s life, set up and began scooting on the hard floor of the
        facility where Dr. Dhonden was practicing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Marvin was astonished at the effect of the Tibetan doctors herbal medicine, little round balls of herbs and some
        wrapped in pink cloth, multicolored thin thread that tied the ends of the pink cloth. He wondered how they tied
        thread around the little cloth on the quarter inch size pills? The doctors translator said they were precious
        pills prayed over by the monks. Marvin had to go out and purchase a mortar and pestle to crush and dissolve them
        in hot water. Little baby Brock drank the herbs out of his bottle. Oh yes for those of you who may have taken
        herbal medicine might be aware of the taste, it had to be disguised with lots of honey. After seeing his son
        energetically scooting around the floor and literally come alive Dad convinced he was on the right track. He was
        prepared to take little Mihdi to Dharamsala, India, where Dr. Dhonden lived the majority of the time, to give
        his son a chance at life. Unfortunately the doctor told the enthusiastic father, that the conditions at the
        monastery were not favorable for his little boy’s health and life. This was very disappointing for Marvin with
        the doctor agreed to see Mihdi in the future when he returned to North America. The two got back in their car, a
        1983 Mercedes-Benz diesel. Marvin put little Mihdi, back in his car seat among the luggage and provisions of the
        trip. They continue south to San Diego California, to meet with Sifu Share K. Lew, a former Taoist monk, who had
        agreed to see the baby. A pictorial account is in the first book that Marvin chronicled some of the journey.
        More detail can be found in Marvin’s narrative to come.

    <p>
        This life-saving aspect of Marvin’s life dominated his time and energy from the 1996 to 2013. During that time
        he virtually single parenthood his baby son and provided the medical and therapeutic assistance required to save
        his son’s life. Family, friends and supporters supplemented the dwindling residual commission to fund the
        mission for Mihdi. It became quite evident to Marvin in late 1999 that he would require assistance in order to
        fund this effort to save his son’s life. In the beginning Random Acts of Kindness spearheaded by Bermuda
        businessman Steve Thompson included this mission for Mihdi to the fundraising effort on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
        In January 2000 the Mihdi Joon Fund was registered as a charity in Bermuda. The initial Board of Directors
        included Mihdi’s sister Teresa and there where a number of fundraising activities which got the MJF off to a
        good start. A new Board of Directors took the helm later and the fundraising by direct-mail and its own website
        became the principle means of fundraising. Individuals and businesses across Bermuda and overseas regularly
        contributed to the life-saving effort for little Mihdi Brock. Marvin in addition to being a full-time caregiver
        and single-parent to his son was also the principal fundraiser for the charity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mihdi’s parents divorced in the early 2003. Claire agreed that with Marvin’s background in Oriental medicine and
        martial arts her son should live with Marvin who would work hand-in-hand with Dr. Baolin Wu to try and save
        their son. Marvin seeing the efficacy of Oriental medicine with his son, the mission of the Mihdi Joon Fund
        broadened, to educate the public to the benefits of Oriental medicine and to provide assistance to those seeking
        Oriental medical treatment but couldn’t afford to pay for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As time went on it became evident that Oriental medicine was working through the best efforts of Dr. Wu. Marvin
        decided that the charity was a vehicle that could provide his young son an opportunity to give back to all those
        who had contributed to his fight for life. Marvin started his son helping with the fundraising early by
        assisting with fundraising mailings for the MJF, by helping with cleaning up discarded paper after a mailing was
        prepared. The majority of mailings to the Bermuda community originated in their apartment in Santa Monica,
        California and shipped to Bermuda to be mailed. As Mihdi grew older he was able to stuff the envelopes for
        mailings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Marvin’s hope was that Mihdi would be employed with the charity eventually and be able to demonstrate by his
        life the efficacy of Oriental medicine. Several people who had seen the Mihdi Joon Fund website, came to the
        Beijing Chinese Medical Center, seeking life-saving treatments from Dr. Wu. Many including Hollywood actors
        mentioned it was through that site they learned about Dr. Wu. Not only did Marvin learn of such people by
        meeting them in the office five days a week for his son’s treatments which spanned 13 years, but from calls from
        those interested in hearing about the effectiveness of our Oriental medicine for themselves or for their loved
        ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        On February 13, 2013 following a protracted custody case and LA Superior Court judge Christine Bird, awarded
        Mihdi’s mom sole and total custody of the 15-year-old with no rights of communication for his father. Marvin
        understood during the court hearing that this was in an effort to have spine surgery for the teenager. Soon
        after the The Mihdi Joon Fund was closed and Marvin’s dream that Mihdi would be able to give back by working in
        the charity and that the fund would fulfill its mission and help others. Doctors at Mayo Clinic had told Marvin
        when, there for a week long evaluation of his son that he danced to a different drummer. They said many parents
        and their children to the hospital and turn them over to the doctors looking for miracles. They saw Marvin as
        someone who doesn’t give up easily and commanded him on his efforts to save his then 12 year old. This
        steadfastness continues to be evident with Marvin as he still holds out hope forming a charity to promote the
        efficacy of Oriental medicine and help others seeking Oriental medical treatment but are unable to pay for it.
        This phase of Marvin’s life appeared to be coming to a close as he had no further contact with his son, by court
        order, the funds that supported he and his son and The Mission for Mihdi terminated there was no longer a way to
        sustain life in Santa Monica California. The earnings that were taken from Marvin in 1996, prevented him from
        securing legal help and forced him to leave Santa Monica and proximity to his son.
