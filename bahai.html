    <p>As a member of the Baha’i Faith, Marvin decided to follow the example of others such as the Catholics, and
        Muslims and give his children education based on his Faith. As there were no such schools in Bermuda he
        researched Baha’i schools worldwide and he and his wife Claire settled on the Maxwell International Baha’i
        School, in British Columbia, Canada. His older daughter Teresa, had recently graduated from the University of
        Tampa with a degree in business and had returned home to run M.A.Brock Limited. Marvin’s plan was to go into
        semi retirement and spend more time helping his wife with the younger children as they attended school in
        Canada. </p>
    <p>He planned to alternate time between family in British Columbia and with Teresa in the business on the island.
        The internet was such at that time that there could be a continuous link with his daughter in the business.
        However a life changing situation arose when Marvin was denied the commission earned from the sale of a major
        group health insurance case to a local hotel. His existing commissions, were also stopped by the primary health
        insurance company he placed business with. His family which relocated to Canada for the education of his three
        youngest children was left without income. This was a major shock for all and came while they were on the
        beginning of a Summer vacation to show the children North America by driving across Canada and down through the
        U.S. and back up the West coast to the school for the fall.</p>
