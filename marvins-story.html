Marvin, born on the little subtropical island of Bermuda, shortly after World War II and apart of one of the largest human explosions on record, the Baby Boomers, was beginning an adventure of a lifetime!</p>

<p>Not long after, Asthma defined the first sixteen years of the young boy’s life as he struggled to breath and doctors were a regular part of his life. Less than one hundred and fifty years out of slavery, people of African Descent such as, his parents worked hard in their early lives and some eventually and became business owners. This for his Dad was a form of independence as with other offspring of slaves; Mansfield Brock gained a reputation as a photographer and Barber in the Black community. Later he and wife Mary founded Brock’s Self-Service and with the children became the main focus of their lives. Their primary goal was for their children to be college graduates. They achieved their goal when Marvin the last of their three children graduated from Shaw University in the early seventies. It can be said without a doubt that they were successful in achieving their goal.</p>

<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Marvin's parents and their children" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c856923c-6546-440a-97be-04ef511fdade" height="589" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/Mans-%20Mary%20and%20children.jpg" width="696" /><figcaption>Marvin's parents and their children</figcaption></figure><p>Challenged with this chronic illness one of young Marvin’s physicians, Dr. Barbara Ball a pediatrician, advised his parents to send him to her Judo school. He began at age eleven and that was the beginning of a lifelong involvement in the martial arts. That also opened the door for Marvin to participate in school sports, such as football, that’s what it’s called in Bermuda, the UK and many other countries. In America and some other countries it is also known as soccer. He dabbled in cricket and track and field as well. Family members especially cousins were outstanding in football and Cricket he longed be a part of that tradition but that wasn’t to be. Due to Marvin’s chronic asthmatic condition, winters in Bermuda, without central heat, were especially challenging.</p>

<p>Kerosene heaters and fireplaces, warmed many homes on the rock, as the island is sometimes called, for the first decade or more of Marvin’s life that is how he spent most winters. He was indoors of their heated home with caregivers to avoid the illness, brought on by the damp and cold. Next door neighbors, the Martins, would tell of Marvin being one of the first children in the neighborhood to have a television. He was not able to attend school on a regular basis in the winter months so his parents arranged for his cousin, an elementary school teacher, to tutor him from winter to spring, the TV was his entertainment. Other times were spent looking out of the windows and playing games.</p>

<p>History tells of slavery on the island from near its discovery, to the mid-eighteen hundreds through its abolition and segregation through 70s. Bermuda wrestled with racism and segregation where, Black Bermudians who made up the majority of the Population, attended schools exclusively for them. Whites attended their own schools which were deemed better. The little island, 600 miles off the coast of America, is not alone in this historical circumstance. As with its distant southern neighbor, North Carolina, many conditions, not just in education were quite similar to that of Bermuda, Marvin would later find. The distance however provided a natural barrier between the two and Bermudian’s were filtered from what the ruling class didn’t want to be seen or heard on the island. Marvin’s lifestyle conditioned by illness and segregation was like, somewhat of a bubble. However high school began to thrust this young boy into a greater awareness of his island country. Howard Academy where he attended high school for two years was deemed a rebel school. The educators and students were not accepting of convention and therefore sort, through education for its students to be unshackled from racism and segregation on the island.</p>

<p>The government was determined to close the school, eventually it was shut down but only after its board and educators fought a protracted battle to keep the school open but lost that fight in the early 60s. Just prior to the closure of the school Marvin’s parents decided to send him abroad to a seventh day Adventist boarding school, in the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania to finish his high school education. They thought that the drier climate of America particularly the mountains of Pennsylvania would be better for Marvin’s asthmatic condition then the humid island he grew up on. Twenty-one square miles, nineteen miles long and two and a half miles at its widest, surrounded by over six hundred miles of ocean created high humidity.</p>

<p>At 14 years of age Marvin encountered a whole new way of life, in a country with unimaginably wide roads, big cars with wings, many with four headlights. These cars and trucks longer than he had ever seen would speed on highways that seemingly went on forever. The strangeness of America became a challenge for the young teen. He explored the rivers and the Allegheny Mountains near Pine Forge Academy which became not only his new high school but his home away from home, during many weekends, for the next five years. Clad in boots, hunting socks, shorts and the machete he found on campus he hiked the mountains and swam in the Manatawny for hours at a time. Unbeknownst to him he was being conditioned, growing in strength constantly. The asthma that plagued him for most of his life became less prominent. He became so adapt at his new life that the Bermudian would cut a hole in the ice covered Manatawny River and jump in, the river bordered the campus. One particular incident that punctuated his adventurousness was when he and two of his buddies borrowed the schools canoe in the spring one year when the ice began to break on the river and paddled five miles to nearby Pottstown, Pennsylvania.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="dbae2fb1-da35-427b-92b8-811b5829cc67" height="764" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/Canoed%20five%20miles%20down%20the%20ice%20covered%20river.jpg" width="838" /><figcaption>Marvin and his friends get stuck in the icy river</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>Marvin and his friends were on a buying trip, they wanted Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, as Pine Forge Academy was vegetarian, actually ovolackto. The young teens didn’t realize however that the rushing waters that took them on a incredible ride into town amid the broken slabs and chunks of ice, would be nearly impossible to negotiate, back to campus. As a matter of fact, it was the rushing waters in addition to an enormous slabs of ice, that were perilous to them In their attempt to pull the canoe onto one such wide piece of ice, the canoe capsized. Frigid waters, several foot-long cheesesteak sandwiches, tucked in his lumber jacket and silk at the bottom of the raging waters almost claimed his life. Marvin was forced to abandon his galoshes stuck in the mud at the bottom of the river and much to his chagrin is lumberjack and his Philly cheesesteaks.</p>

<p>The Bermudian youngster managed to swim underwater to the riverbanks where he crawled to the surface to see the roadside lined with people. His fellow adventurers were across the street safe in a nearby automobile garage. It appears he was the last one to surface. The school sent an open pickup truck to collect the boys. Wrapped in blankets, they rode the five freezing miles back to school in the open bed of the pickup. Marvin mused at which conditions were worse, the icy waters of the river or the frigid cold and wind of the back of the truck.</p>

<p>Pine Forge Academy, all though a coeducational Seventh-day Adventist boarding school, had a strict code of conduct where boys and girls were closely monitored. Later in life Marvin associated that lifestyle to a monastery. This all later became clear to him that these were building blocks of life for him.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="59b939f3-62d2-42de-8fae-80783d74820d" height="408" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/IMG_0009.jpg" width="663" /><figcaption>Marvin graduates from Pine Forge</figcaption></figure><p>The school became an enormous learning experience for the island teen as he obtained his drivers license at age 16, joined the maintenance staff at school, simultaneously he did other work-study in the cafeteria where he took over the management of it for just under six weeks while the cafeteria matron underwent and recovered from surgery. Not only did he have to maintain his school work, attend class and study, he also had to prepare three meals a day for students and staff numbering over 400. During meetings with the controller, they developed a friendship and Marvin would walk to and from Pottstown on weekends with the former Army Captain. He and Capt. Walker, as he was referred to, routinely made the brisk walks, there and back. Initially Marvin recalls losing sight of the captain around bends on the road. In his mind Marvin would say to himself, no wonder they call him Capt. Walker, referring to his ability to walk so fast. The captain stood over six feet tall and there was a striking difference between the two as Marvin stood around 5 foot seven. Over time the teen was able to walk side-by-side with his mentor, even as the paste increased. Much was learned by the teen, from a 21 square mile island of 60,000 people, during his initial five years in America. As Marvin’s high school experience drew to an end, he wanted to follow in the footsteps of some of his schoolmates and join the Army to become a Green Beret or join the famed screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne Division. However his father made a deal with him. He was soon on a bus to Raleigh North Carolina where the next four years were transformative.</p>

<p>It was there, at Shaw University, the birth place of the student nonviolent coordinating committee, otherwise known as “SNCC”, where Marvin learned about being black in America. The long bus ride from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Raleigh, North Carolina was almost like a live representation of some of the books he had read such as, Uncle Tom’s cabin. As if to cement this in his psyche, he encountered the black experience in southern America upfront and personal. As he arrived at the school after six in the evening, laden with a trunk and suitcases containing all his belongings he found the cafeteria closed and nowhere to eat. Famished he remembered seeing the Trailways bus depot on his arrival; it was across the road from where he was dropped off. He walked back to see if he could get a sandwich, out of a vending machine. It was an older building, two doors in the front, one looked sparkling white and newly painted, the other as if part of a restoration project. As he the approached the shinny door, he peered through the circular glass window, he saw a white man in a white tee shirt, behind the counter. As he turned the doorknob and opened the door the man he saw through the window was no longer standing behind the counter.</p>

<p>This was 1966 and the Bermudian teen having lived in the mountains of Pennsylvania for the previous five years had no knowledge of life for blacks in the South and North Carolina in particular. As he entered the building he could see that it was a restaurant, the side he was on, of a sparkling chrome railing down dividing it, looked as though there was a renovation underway but incomplete. White tablecloths covered the small square tables with salt-and-pepper shakers on them. The floor was clean on that side. As he turned his head he was curious as to why the other side hadn’t been petitioned off as the renovation obviously had not begun as bare tables still stood. He climbed on the circular barstools in front of an immaculate long wooden, beautiful bar. The beautiful wood grain could be seen through what looked to be many coats of clear shellac. He couldn’t help but glance over at the other side and noticed a water fountain on the wall, it looked filthy. It looked as if a flood had left its high water mark on it and no one ever cleaned it. The tables looked as if they hadn’t been cleaned, the floor unsweapted.</p>

<p>When he turned to face the counter again it was as if someone turned the lights out, he was shocked and couldn’t figure out what had happened as he began to focus he noticed light coming from above as if between his eyes, pulled back from the counter as he heard two metal clicks and realized he was looking down a double barrel shotgun. He instinctly wanted knock the gun away and even turn it around to face the holder. He recognized white T-shirt as his eyes fixed on the heavyset white man holding the shotgun. There was a brown stain coloring the front the man’s Tee shirt and the smell of sweat when he heard the man talking about Niggras. He had never heard that word before <strong>but</strong> it wasn’t time or place to figure out what he was talking about. Marvin’s only thought was taking the gun or backing out the restaurant. The white man in the dirty T-shirt continued to talk about Niggras and there was one living next door who he gave watermelon to. While he continued to talk Marvin had eased off the stool and began backing across the floor and up the slight ramp to the door, he reached behind him, felt the doorknob as the heavyset man continued to talk. Once outside on the sidewalk away from the firmly closed in front of him; he glanced to his right to the little voices he heard coming from under huge evergreen tree. There playing in the dirt were two young brown skinned children with blue eyes and ginger hair. I thought instantly of the parish of St. George back home on the island. That was the Bermudian teen’s first hand southern experience, welcome to North Carolina.</p>

<p>The next four years at Shaw University in Raleigh North Carolina, Marvin’s life changed forever. Not only was he profoundly awakened to his identity as a black person he embraced it wholeheartedly. Over the period he would experience other such incidents, minus the shotgun in the face except, one it would be poignant to note that he arrived in 1966 during what some might consider the height of the civil rights period. He declared his major in psychology and envisioned a leather couch somewhat ornate, outlining the diamond shape design and the matching comfortable chair. This vision change however when the University established a communications department and WSHA- FM, its own radio station. A good friend of Marvin’s, Fraser Foster suggested he would be a good radio personality and that he should go up and see the director. Marvin changed his major from psychology to Communication, Radio TV and Motion Picture, specifically.</p>

<p>The collaboration between Ohio State University and Shaw resulted in radio programming being more reflective of the culture of Ohio State possibly, then that of Shaw University, its students and the community in which it was located. The station was run by a student staff and supervised by professor Czech. Marvin and fellow staff convinced her to allow him to have an R&amp;B show and Jazz programming in the schedule. This later resulted in Marvelous Marv’s Music with Soul R&amp;B show and added Cold Duck Time, a jazz show. The soul music program soon became extremely popular on campus and the nearby community as well as greater Raleigh. Marvin was strongly encouraged by professor Elizabeth Czech , to study and become a broadcast journalist. Repeatedly urged him to become news reader and reporter; he eventually became news director.</p>

<p>This led him to cover the takeover of the Willard straight Hall at Cornell University, on which he produced a two week documentary. He also interviewed personalities such as<strong> </strong> <strong>James Brown</strong> and <strong>Martha Reeves</strong> of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. Marvin was also active in other areas on campus and connected with Minister Kenneth X, the Imam of the local Nation of Islam community, to invite <strong>Mohammed Ali</strong> to the school for the CUBS Conference.</p>

This was following such similar actions on other college campuses around the nation. The Afro wearing dashiki clad Marvin soon became aware that the greater community required more conventional attire. The internship, which he initiated with WKIX – AM/FM required a suit and tie. He represented the station throughout the city as a reporter, covering the City Council meetings, the governor’s office, the police department and other events in the Triangle area. He won the best investigative reporter award for the station by producing a documentary on the North Carolina Prison system. He was the first journalist to be allowed in the prison system to produce a documentary.</p>

<p>On graduation the young Bermudian was hired by the station as a reporter. He was continuously concerned however that he didn’t have the deep radio voice that many at the time had on radio and decided to move into television. He had been exposed to television earlier when co-hosting JD William’s dance program on local station WRAL TV. In the early seventies he was hired by WGHP-TV in High Point North Carolina and worked his way up to Bureau Chief of its Greensboro office. He encountered considerable work place challenges that prompted him to apply for a position in CBS Network Internship program. He was invited to audition at WBBM – TV in Chicago by then News Director Van Gordon Sauter. The two week stint was followed by an offer to work at a station in Louisville, Kentucky. It was at this time that another life changing even occurred in the young man’s life. He was contacted by a Greensboro Life Insurance Agent who had met Marvin’s father, during a vacation he had in Bermuda. On hearing of the challenges the young reporter was encountering at the High Point station, he suggested Marvin look at the independence of being a Life Insurance career. The recently married reporter, was now expecting a child and wanted to provide a more secure future for his family. He applied for a position with Penn Mutual Lfe Insurance company’s agency in Greensboro. He was hired after an extensive process.</p>
<img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8e5f456e-294f-4315-b9a2-9295ac828e97" height="566" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/Marvin%20A.%20Brock%20Sr.%20WKIX%20News%201971%20001.jpg" width="695" class="align-center" /><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="98b0d1e5-19d6-4b6e-858c-bea57878ff81" height="567" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/1476576_10151744964186371_835666456_n.jpg" width="734" class="align-center" /><p> </p>

<p>That was the beginning of a career that lasted the majority of his working career. He soon realized that building a Life Insurance business would have him and his family in a fixed location for the majority of his career and life. Emerging from a challenging beginning in a new industry, not what he studied in University, he and his wife with their newborn relocated to his island home of Bermuda. He had been hired by The Bermuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company as a Life and Health agent. In Greensboro he nearly missed qualifying for the prestigious Million Dollar Round Table for Life Insurance agents. He rectified that with his new company in his island home. That began consecutive membership to earn a life and qualifying status with the MDRT.</p>

<p>One of the motivations for the family relocation was Marvin’s desire for his son to experience the beautiful island and beaches he grew up knowing. He also wanted Marvin junior to know his grandparents as well as his aunts, uncles and cousins there. The marriage to his college sweetheart ended and father and son were separated as well. Those were tumultuous times in the families’ lives and opportunities for growth especially for Marvin sr., he sold a group health plan to the largest bakery on the island, The Bermuda Bakery. Unwittingly he upset the status quo and the oligarchy. As a result was called to meet with Sir James Pearman, the heads of the two major insurance companies on the island at the time. Unfortunately his relationship with his initial local company was severed with no commission for the bakery business, a loss of over $30,000.00. As a result he struggled to provide for his family. He negotiation with the owner of the largest super market operation about health insurance but when telling the company, he was told another agent was insuring a sister company and the business would need to go to him. Marvin was extremely frustrated and had second thoughts about his return home. Terminated from the local company, he figured he would be better suited with an international insurance company and joined Manufacturers Life of Canada. At the same time he established an agent relationship with Colonial Insurance Company and The Argus Group. It was then that He met with Sir Dudley Spurling who was the head of a few businesses the new agent was trying to sell coverage to. Marvin would find Sir Dudley a true gentleman and of great character. He soon became one of the top agents in the local branch and among the company’s recognized salesmen. During this time his mother had been diagnosed with cancer. While hospitalized with the cancer worsening he was informed on the street outside the branch by the local manager one Saturday that he no longer worked for the company. Two weeks later, his mother lost her battle with cancer. Marvin decided to return to broadcasting and joined a local company. Although he received many accolades from viewers the relationship and atmosphere in the newsroom was increasingly worsening. He left ZBM and spent the six months on the beach trying to figure out what to do.</p>
<img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4622b28d-a30f-4077-8325-8fdf424158fa" height="416" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/EPSON007_2.jpg" width="300" class="align-center" /><p>As a result of the significant changes that had encompassed Marvin in his return to the land of his birth, separated from wife and son, no job, he retreated to the beach to try and make sense of all that had happened. While spending many days on one of the islands most popular beaches he met old friends from childhood and began running and swimming. At first he ran just a little along the wet sand of the surf. Over time he became friends with athletes such as Raymond Swan one of Bermuda’s premier marathoners. Gradually he increased his distances on the hard sand along the surf. He slowly move up to the drier deeper sand and onto the dunes. He swam following the runs and the distances increased both on the sand and in the water. He was running two and a half miles on Horseshoe Beach to the end of Long Beach and back. He also lapped the bay four or five times. This coupled with Martial Arts training in the dojo three times a week, developed a level of fitness that he had never known. He was joined on nine to twelve mile runs with friends and cousins but the nineteen and twenty mile runs were often alone. He bought a racing bike and added cycling to his regiment and soon cycled to the pool at sunrise for a swim, cycled to the office only a few blocks away, spent lunch in the gym weight training with Cliff Lobby an old friend from his days body building in his late teens.</p>
<img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f09b4a98-4418-4563-810e-97d523948c0f" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/Close-up%20floating.JPG" class="align-center" /><p>The program was very effective as he became efficient in the office as he continued to build M.A Brock Limited. He continually qualified for the MDRT yearly. Late afternoon before the traffic of people leaving work he would alternate cycling to the Bermuda Arts and Fitness Karate dojo or go for a twenty five or fifty mile ride. The days that he trained in the Uechi-Ryu dojo he could often be seen running five miles home pushing his bike, either by the handles or the seat. Brock became extremely fit and couldn’t understand why an office administrator on the fourth floor, the same floor as his office could beat him up the eight flights of stairs. They often encountered each other on the first floor and being a gentleman he insisted she go first, she would hike up the front of her long flowing dress and the race was on. She would take two to three steps at a time. He soon realized that she was the new administrator of one of his clients business. He along with most other Black Bermudians did not date white women but as Marvin had recently become a member of the Baha’i Faith he had to look at himself in the transformation process he was undergoing and found he was not adhering to the principle of the Faith that required him to eliminate prejudice of all kinds in his daily life. It was then he realized he did not dated white women. It took a lot of courage but slowly he did and when he realized he was attracted to this administrator who could beat him running the stairs he eventually asked he out to dinner. She had a daughter from her previous marriage and he had a son. The two married and blended Black and White into an unusual family on the island in the early eighties. It caused quite a stir he would later learn when as terms that it was not appreciated or liked.</p>

He maintained his athletic program but soon the demands of family life had abandon his dream of completing the Ironman in Hawaii. He cut back his training to just the martial arts and an occasional run most with his wife and new daughter. In the late eighties his father who stood by him during his fight with asthma supported him through his educational career was suddenly taken by a massive heart attack. After which Marvin felt it would be wise to take over his father’s taxi operation and purchased the taxis left too his sister and brother. He had heard his father talk of the solution for many of the challenges of the Bermuda taxi industry. One was to have purpose built taxis. As his family grew he felt the need for the security of another income producing asset and began researching purpose built vehicles for his three taxis.</p>

<p>His research lead him to the London taxi as the best suited for Bermuda’s laws and roads. Marvin traveled to the London Taxi International in Coventry, UK to further research that particular vehicle and make sure it would work for Bermuda. There he saw what would normally be seen on the roads of London as well as a deluxe model which was more like a limousine. He decided the deluxe model could serve two purposes on the island one as an executive vehicle, as well as a normal taxi.</p>

<p>Marvin was able to secure a dealership for the vehicles and returned to the island to establish London Taxi Bermuda Limited and a subsidiary London Taxi Executive Travel. The cars were an instant hit among locals as well as tourists. Soon after, with little marketing, the Executive Service was in high demand by locals, international businesses, high profile visitors and hotels. It served the likes of Young and the Restless, Michael Jordan, Galen Weston and many others.</p>

<p>Marvin found the demands for that operation so great and with inadequate management support that he had to choose between the profitable three year old travel business and his long established insurance concern. He decided to focus his energies on the insurance operation and built it into a very successful firm. He provided Estate Planning Services for residents and Life and health insurance for individuals and businesses. He worked with local law firms, accounting and trust companies to provide tailor made estate plans for M.A. Brock Limited clients. As a result many were able to keep promises made to their families even after death. He was able to impact many more people with the group health plans he provided through local businesses and hotels.</p>

<p>As a member of the Baha’i Faith, Marvin decided to follow the example of others such as the Catholics, and Muslims and give his children education based on his Faith. As there were no such schools in Bermuda he researched Baha’i schools worldwide and he and his wife Claire settled on the Maxwell International Baha’i School, in British Columbia, Canada. His older daughter Teresa, had recently graduated from the University of Tampa with a degree in business and had returned home to run M.A.Brock Limited. Marvin’s plan was to go into semi retirement and spend more time helping his wife with the younger children as they attended school in Canada. He planned to alternate time between family in British Columbia and with Teresa in the business on the island. The internet was such at that time that there could be a continuous link with his daughter in the business. However a life changing situation arose when Marvin was denied the commission earned from the sale of a major group health insurance case to a local hotel. His existing commissions, were also stopped by the primary health insurance company he placed business with. His family which relocated to Canada for the education of his three youngest children was left without income. This was a major shock for all and came while they were on the beginning of a Summer vacation to show the children North America by driving across Canada and down through the U.S. and back up the West coast to the school for the fall.</p>

He left his family with relatives in New England and he flew to Bermuda to sort out what he knew, had to be a mistake. He managed to secure some of the commission income from previously established business but the he was told he would not receive the commission from the sale of the group health plan to Sonesta Beach Hotel. Marvin and his family now traumatized, aborted their educational trip through the U.S. and returned to British Columbia, but the house they were renting was sublet and they were forced to camp for over a month until their house would become available.</p>

<p>The family was hit with another life changing event when Mom newly pregnant had an accidental fall in the first trimester of her pregnancy. In order to go to term doctors advised her to have total bed rest for the next six months. Marvin had to care for the three girls and his pregnant wife during this time to save the baby. Approximately two months after their son was born doctors determined the young child was failing to thrive. Tests showed that he had an abnormality of his aorta and required immediate heart surgery to save his life. Another major shock reverberated through the Brock family in Canada when Marvin was told the little one was not covered under their group health plan with Colonial Insurance company. His six month old baby needed heart surgery immediately or would die within about two weeks doctors at British Columbia Children’s Hospital told Marvin and his wife Claire. A flurry of activity to save his little boy ensued and Marvin was able to secure BCMed a provincial health plan for his family. It covered the cost of the baby’s heart surgery. A year later with no resolution over the relationship with Colonial and earned income, Claire and children relocated to New England for security as neither Mom or Dad could work in Canada. They watched as business income began to quickly shrink as Colonial management offered Brock’s clients a premium discount if they switched to Colonial directly.</p>

<p>Less than a year later, Marvin and Claire were told by doctors at Harvard’s Boston Children’s Hospital that their little baby’s spine was curving at two degrees, a month and there was nothing that could be done for him. Marvin a long time martial artist told the doctor he had seen Chinese martial artists perform inexplicable feats and if British Columbia Children’s, Dartmouth and Boston Children’s couldn’t save his son, he would try the Chinese. Marvin and baby spent the next two months driving all across Canada and the western U.S. in search of a way to save his baby boy. After a further expedition of a few months in search of a solution, Marvin and Mihdi found Dr. Baolin Wu. Dr. Wu had written a book “Lighting the Eye of The Dragon”, which a friend and school mate of Marvin’s discovered in a bookstore in B.C.</p>

<p>Father and son had raised the funds to go to Beijing, China to secure the help of Monks and doctors of the White Cloud Monastery. Raven Cloudwalker told Marvin that the author and former monk of the monastery was practicing medicine in Santa Monica, near Los Angeles, California. Marvin arranged to layover in Los Angeles in order to get the former monk to write out directions to the taxi driver in Beijing to take them to the monastery. The father and son never did get back on that Northwest flight to China.</p>

<p>Little Mihdi couldn’t walk or talk November 18, 2000 when he and Dad first arrived at the Beijing Chinese Medical Center. It was in Oakland California, a couple of months earlier when Mihdi and his father saw the Dalai Lama’s physician Dr. Yechi Dhonden that little Mihdi took what some would consider a miraculous change. The little baby boy who was like a wet noodle in the crook of his father’s arm for months, as they drove across North America in search of a way to save the baby’s life, set up and began scooting on the hard floor of the facility where Dr. Dhonden was practicing.</p>

<p>Marvin was astonished at the effect of the Tibetan doctors herbal medicine, little round balls of herbs and some wrapped in pink cloth, multicolored thin thread that tied the ends of the pink cloth. He wondered how they tied thread around the little cloth on the quarter inch size pills? The doctors translator said they were precious pills prayed over by the monks. Marvin had to go out and purchase a mortar and pestle to crush and dissolve them in hot water. Little baby Brock drank the herbs out of his bottle. Oh yes for those of you who may have taken herbal medicine might be aware of the taste, it had to be disguised with lots of honey. After seeing his son energetically scooting around the floor and literally come alive Dad convinced he was on the right track. He was prepared to take little Mihdi to Dharamsala, India, where Dr. Dhonden lived the majority of the time, to give his son a chance at life. Unfortunately the doctor told the enthusiastic father, that the conditions at the monastery were not favorable for his little boy’s health and life. This was very disappointing for Marvin with the doctor agreed to see Mihdi in the future when he returned to North America. The two got back in their car, a 1983 Mercedes-Benz diesel. Marvin put little Mihdi, back in his car seat among the luggage and provisions of the trip. They continue south to San Diego California, to meet with Sifu Share K. Lew, a former Taoist monk, who had agreed to see the baby. A pictorial account is in the first book that Marvin chronicled some of the journey. More detail can be found in Marvin’s narrative to come.</p>

<p>This life-saving aspect of Marvin’s life dominated his time and energy from the 1996 to 2013. During that time he virtually single parenthood his baby son and provided the medical and therapeutic assistance required to save his son’s life. Family, friends and supporters supplemented the dwindling residual commission to fund the mission for Mihdi. It became quite evident to Marvin in late 1999 that he would require assistance in order to fund this effort to save his son’s life. In the beginning Random Acts of Kindness spearheaded by Bermuda businessman Steve Thompson included this mission for Mihdi to the fundraising effort on the island.</p>

<p>In January 2000 the Mihdi Joon Fund was registered as a charity in Bermuda. The initial Board of Directors included Mihdi’s sister Teresa and there where a number of fundraising activities which got the MJF off to a good start. A new Board of Directors took the helm later and the fundraising by direct-mail and its own website became the principle means of fundraising. Individuals and businesses across Bermuda and overseas regularly contributed to the life-saving effort for little Mihdi Brock. Marvin in addition to being a full-time caregiver and single-parent to his son was also the principal fundraiser for the charity.</p>

<p>Mihdi’s parents divorced in the early 2003. Claire agreed that with Marvin’s background in Oriental medicine and martial arts her son should live with Marvin who would work hand-in-hand with Dr. Baolin Wu to try and save their son. Marvin seeing the efficacy of Oriental medicine with his son, the mission of the Mihdi Joon Fund broadened, to educate the public to the benefits of Oriental medicine and to provide assistance to those seeking Oriental medical treatment but couldn’t afford to pay for it.</p>

<p>As time went on it became evident that Oriental medicine was working through the best efforts of Dr. Wu. Marvin decided that the charity was a vehicle that could provide his young son an opportunity to give back to all those who had contributed to his fight for life. Marvin started his son helping with the fundraising early by assisting with fundraising mailings for the MJF, by helping with cleaning up discarded paper after a mailing was prepared. The majority of mailings to the Bermuda community originated in their apartment in Santa Monica, California and shipped to Bermuda to be mailed. As Mihdi grew older he was able to stuff the envelopes for mailings.</p>

<p>Marvin’s hope was that Mihdi would be employed with the charity eventually and be able to demonstrate by his life the efficacy of Oriental medicine. Several people who had seen the Mihdi Joon Fund website, came to the Beijing Chinese Medical Center, seeking life-saving treatments from Dr. Wu. Many including Hollywood actors mentioned it was through that site they learned about Dr. Wu. Not only did Marvin learn of such people by meeting them in the office five days a week for his son’s treatments which spanned 13 years, but from calls from those interested in hearing about the effectiveness of our Oriental medicine for themselves or for their loved ones.</p>

<p>On February 13, 2013 following a protracted custody case and LA Superior Court judge Christine Bird, awarded Mihdi’s mom sole and total custody of the 15-year-old with no rights of communication for his father. Marvin understood during the court hearing that this was in an effort to have spine surgery for the teenager. Soon after the The Mihdi Joon Fund was closed and Marvin’s dream that Mihdi would be able to give back by working in the charity and that the fund would fulfill its mission and help others. Doctors at Mayo Clinic had told Marvin when, there for a week long evaluation of his son that he danced to a different drummer. They said many parents and their children to the hospital and turn them over to the doctors looking for miracles. They saw Marvin as someone who doesn’t give up easily and commanded him on his efforts to save his then 12 year old. This steadfastness continues to be evident with Marvin as he still holds out hope forming a charity to promote the efficacy of Oriental medicine and help others seeking Oriental medical treatment but are unable to pay for it. This phase of Marvin’s life appeared to be coming to a close as he had no further contact with his son, by court order, the funds that supported he and his son and The Mission for Mihdi terminated there was no longer a way to sustain life in Santa Monica California. The earnings that were taken from Marvin in 1996, prevented him from securing legal help and forced him to leave Santa Monica and proximity to his son.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the mission, Marvin took one of his teenagers to a conference in Arizona, during which he met one of the speakers, Erica Toussaint. Three years later the two married and Erica divided her time living in Santa Monica, California with Marvin and Mihdi and her home in the Portland, Oregon. She was serving on the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the United States and speaking at gatherings throughout North America. The two were committed to seeing that the teen that had beaten the odds had the treatments and support needed to reach a stage, were his spinal bones hardened and he reached age 18. The mission and years of hourly and daily effort of Marvin for his son was over!</p>

On March 1, 2013 Marvin and Erica had relocated to her home in Oregon. It was clear to Marvin that he had not taken the best of care of himself over the past 18 years. He went into retreat at his new home, reviving and expanding the garden. During this time he built a greenhouse. He also built amenities for his studio, such as bookshelves, a ladder to the loft. For over a year this occupied Marvin’s daily life. He followed the prescription of his doctors, meditate four hours a day, engage in rigorous study and climb a mountain once a month. Dr. Wu recommended he start by building up to walking 10 miles a day, this would also afford Marvin the fitness to climb a mountain once a month. Marvin concluded quickly that it would take time to build up to walking 10 miles a day again.</p>

<p>With new health and vigor Marvin determined it was time to get to work but with no income the first step would be to work for someone. He sought to get employ using the skills and competency he acquired in acupressure and massage over the years. A local doctor offered him a position in his group. Marvin soon discovered however that in Oregon there was no reciprocity with other states. That meant his certification in those area, valid in California could not be used. In order to be recertified in Oregon he discovered that going back to school was the best option. There was little difference in the time required to become recertified and becoming an acupuncturist, decided to complete his studies in Oriental medicine become a doctor of Oriental medicine.</p>

<p>There was a hiccup along the way, to gain admission to either of the two Oriental medical school in the Portland area he had to satisfy the prerequisites. Portland State University accepted Marvin’s undergraduate degree and he began studying anatomy and physiology, psychology, physics and chemistry. He was inspired to apply to the National College of Natural Medicine and was accepted in its doctoral program Oriental medicine. Marvin’s journey continues…</p>
