<p>At 14 years of age Marvin encountered a whole
  new way of life, in a
  country with unimaginably wide roads, big cars with wings, many with
  four headlights. These cars and trucks longer than he had ever seen
  would speed on highways that seemingly went on forever. The strangeness
  of America became a challenge for the young teen. He explored the
  rivers and the Allegheny Mountains near Pine Forge Academy which became
  not only his new high school but his home away from home, during many
  weekends, for the next five years. Clad in boots, hunting socks, shorts
  and the machete he found on campus he hiked the mountains and swam in
  the Manatawny for hours at a time. Unbeknownst to him he was being
  conditioned, growing in strength constantly. The asthma that plagued
  him for most of his life became less prominent. He became so adapt at
  his new life that the Bermudian would cut a hole in the ice covered
  Manatawny River and jump in, the river bordered the campus. One
  particular incident that punctuated his adventurousness was when he and
  two of his buddies borrowed the schools canoe in the spring one year
  when the ice began to break on the river and paddled five miles to
  nearby Pottstown, Pennsylvania.
  </p>

  <p>Marvin and his friends were on a buying trip, they wanted Philly
  cheesesteak sandwiches, as Pine Forge Academy was vegetarian, actually
  ovolackto. The young teens didn&#8217;t realize however that the rushing
  waters that took them on a incredible ride into town amid the broken
  slabs and chunks of ice, would be nearly impossible to negotiate, back
  to campus. As a matter of fact, it was the rushing waters in addition
  to an enormous slabs of ice, that were perilous to them In their
  attempt to pull the canoe onto one such wide piece of ice, the canoe
  capsized. Frigid waters, several foot-long cheesesteak sandwiches,
  tucked in his lumber jacket and silk at the bottom of the raging waters
  almost claimed his life. Marvin was forced to abandon his galoshes
  stuck in the mud at the bottom of the river and much to his chagrin is
  lumberjack and his Philly cheesesteaks.</p>

  <p>The Bermudian youngster managed to swim underwater to the riverbanks
  where he crawled to the surface to see the roadside lined with people.
  His fellow adventurers were across the street safe in a nearby
  automobile garage. It appears he was the last one to surface. The
  school sent an open pickup truck to collect the boys. Wrapped in
  blankets, they rode the five freezing miles back to school in the open
  bed of the pickup. Marvin mused at which conditions were worse, the icy
  waters of the river or the frigid cold and wind of the back of the
  truck.</p>

  <p>Pine Forge Academy, all though a coeducational Seventh-day Adventist
  boarding school, had a strict code of conduct where boys and girls were
  closely monitored. Later in life Marvin associated that lifestyle to a
  monastery. This all later became clear to him that these were building
  blocks of life for him.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The
  school became an enormous learning experience for the island teen as he
  obtained his drivers license at age 16, joined the maintenance staff at
  school, simultaneously he did other work-study in the cafeteria where
  he took over the management of it for just under six weeks while the
  cafeteria matron underwent and recovered from surgery. Not only did he
  have to maintain his school work, attend class and study, he also had
  to prepare three meals a day for students and staff numbering over 400.
  During meetings with the controller, they developed a friendship and
  Marvin would walk to and from Pottstown on weekends with the former
  Army Captain. He and Capt. Walker, as he was referred to, routinely
  made the brisk walks, there and back. Initially Marvin recalls losing
  sight of the captain around bends on the road. In his mind Marvin would
  say to himself, no wonder they call him Capt. Walker, referring to his
  ability to walk so fast. The captain stood over six feet tall and there
  was a striking difference between the two as Marvin stood around 5 foot
  seven. Over time the teen was able to walk side-by-side with his
  mentor, even as the paste increased. Much was learned by the teen, from
  a 21 square mile island of 60,000 people, during his initial five years
  in America. As Marvin&#8217;s high school experience drew to an end, he
  wanted to follow in the footsteps of some of his schoolmates and join
  the Army to become a Green Beret or join the famed screaming Eagles of
  the 101st Airborne Division. However his father made a deal with him.
  He was soon on a bus to Raleigh North Carolina where the next four
  years were transformative.</p>
