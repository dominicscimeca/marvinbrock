  <p>During the latter part of the mission, Marvin took one of his teenagers to a conference in Arizona, during which he met one of the speakers, Erica Toussaint. Three years later the two married and Erica divided her time living in Santa Monica, California with Marvin and Mihdi and her home in the Portland, Oregon. She was serving on the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the United States and speaking at gatherings throughout North America. The two were committed to seeing that the teen that had beaten the odds had the treatments and support needed to reach a stage, were his spinal bones hardened and he reached age 18. The mission and years of hourly and daily effort of Marvin for his son was over!
  </p>

<p>It was clear in, the last days of February 2013, with funds to pay the rent for March frozen by the charity and no Mihdi that it was time to leave the apartment they had lived in for almost the entire time they were in California. On March 1, 2013 Marvin and Erica had relocated to her home in Oregon. It was clear to Marvin that he had not taken the best of care of himself over the past 18 years. He went into retreat at his new home, reviving and expanding the garden. During this time he built a greenhouse. He also built amenities for his studio, such as bookshelves, a ladder to the loft. For over a year this occupied Marvin’s daily life. He followed the prescription of his doctors, meditate four hours a day, engage in rigorous study and climb a mountain once a month. Dr. Wu recommended he start by building up to walking 10 miles a day, this would also afford Marvin the fitness to climb a mountain once a month. Marvin concluded quickly that it would take time to build up to walking 10 miles a day again.
