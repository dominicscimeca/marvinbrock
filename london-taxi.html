    <p>His research lead him to the London taxi as the best suited for
        Bermuda&#8217;s laws and roads. Marvin traveled to the London Taxi
        International in Coventry, UK to further research that particular
        vehicle and make sure it would work for Bermuda. There he saw what
        would normally be seen on the roads of London as well as a deluxe model
        which was more like a limousine. He decided the deluxe model could
        serve two purposes on the island one as an executive vehicle, as well
        as a normal taxi.</p>


    <p>Marvin was able to secure a dealership for the vehicles and returned
        to the island to establish London Taxi Bermuda Limited and a subsidiary
        London Taxi Executive Travel. The cars were an instant hit among locals
        as well as tourists. Soon after, with little marketing, the Executive
        Service was in high demand by locals, international businesses, high
        profile visitors and hotels. It served the likes of Young and the
        Restless, Michael Jordan, Galen Weston and many others.</p>


    <p>Marvin found the demands for that operation so great and with
        inadequate management support that he had to choose between the
        profitable three year old travel business and his long established
        insurance concern. He decided to focus his energies on the insurance
        operation and built it into a very successful firm. He provided Estate
        Planning Services for residents and Life and health insurance for
        individuals and businesses. He worked with local law firms, accounting
        and trust companies to provide tailor made estate plans for M.A. Brock
        Limited clients. As a result many were able to keep promises made to
        their families even after death. He was able to impact many more people
        with the group health plans he provided through local businesses and
        hotels.</p>
