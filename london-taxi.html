  <p>His research lead him to the London taxi as the best suited for
  Bermuda&#8217;s laws and roads. Marvin traveled to the London Taxi
  International in Coventry, UK to further research that particular
  vehicle and make sure it would work for Bermuda. There he saw what
  would normally be seen on the roads of London as well as a deluxe model
  which was more like a limousine. He decided the deluxe model could
  serve two purposes on the island one as an executive vehicle, as well
  as a normal taxi.</p>


  <p>Marvin was able to secure a dealership for the vehicles and returned
  to the island to establish London Taxi Bermuda Limited and a subsidiary
  London Taxi Executive Travel. The cars were an instant hit among locals
  as well as tourists. Soon after, with little marketing, the Executive
  Service was in high demand by locals, international businesses, high
  profile visitors and hotels. It served the likes of Young and the
  Restless, Michael Jordan, Galen Weston and many others.</p>


  <p>Marvin found the demands for that operation so great and with
  inadequate management support that he had to choose between the
  profitable three year old travel business and his long established
  insurance concern. He decided to focus his energies on the insurance
  operation and built it into a very successful firm. He provided Estate
  Planning Services for residents and Life and health insurance for
  individuals and businesses. He worked with local law firms, accounting
  and trust companies to provide tailor made estate plans for M.A. Brock
  Limited clients. As a result many were able to keep promises made to
  their families even after death. He was able to impact many more people
  with the group health plans he provided through local businesses and
  hotels.</p>
