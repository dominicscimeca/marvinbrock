<p>
  It was there, at Shaw University, the birth place of the student
  nonviolent coordinating committee, otherwise known as &#8220;SNCC&#8221;, where
  Marvin learned about being black in America. The long bus ride from
  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Raleigh, North Carolina was almost like a
  live representation of some of the books he had read such as, Uncle
  Tom&#8217;s cabin. As if to cement this in his psyche, he encountered the
  black experience in southern America upfront and personal. As he
  arrived at the school after six in the evening, laden with a trunk and
  suitcases containing all his belongings he found the cafeteria closed
  and nowhere to eat. Famished he remembered seeing the Trailways bus
  depot on his arrival; it was across the road from where he was dropped
  off. He walked back to see if he could get a sandwich, out of a vending
  machine. It was an older building, two doors in the front, one looked
  sparkling white and newly painted, the other as if part of a
  restoration project. As he the approached the shinny door, he peered
  through the circular glass window, he saw a white man in a white tee
  shirt, behind the counter. As he turned the doorknob and opened the
  door the man he saw through the window was no longer standing behind
  the counter.</p>


  <p>This was 1966 and the Bermudian teen having lived in the mountains
  of Pennsylvania for the previous five years had no knowledge of life
  for blacks in the South and North Carolina in particular. As he entered
  the building he could see that it was a restaurant, the side he was on,
  of a sparkling chrome railing down dividing it, looked as though there
  was a renovation underway but incomplete. White tablecloths covered the
  small square tables with salt-and-pepper shakers on them. The floor was
  clean on that side. As he turned his head he was curious as to why the
  other side hadn&#8217;t been petitioned off as the renovation obviously had
  not begun as bare tables still stood. He climbed on the circular
  barstools in front of an immaculate long wooden, beautiful bar. The
  beautiful wood grain could be seen through what looked to be many coats
  of clear shellac. He couldn&#8217;t help but glance over at the other side
  and noticed a water fountain on the wall, it looked filthy. It looked
  as if a flood had left its high water mark on it and no one ever
  cleaned it. The tables looked as if they hadn&#8217;t been cleaned, the floor
  unsweapted.</p>


  <p>When he turned to face the counter again it was as if someone turned
  the lights out, he was shocked and couldn&#8217;t figure out what had
  happened as he began to focus he noticed light coming from above as if
  between his eyes, pulled back from the counter as he heard two metal
  clicks and realized he was looking down a double barrel shotgun. He
  instinctly wanted knock the gun away and even turn it around to face
  the holder. He recognized white T-shirt as his eyes fixed on the
  heavyset white man holding the shotgun. There was a brown stain
  coloring the front the man&#8217;s Tee shirt and the smell of sweat when he
  heard the man talking about Niggras. He had never heard that word
  before <strong>but</strong> it wasn&#8217;t time or place to figure out what
  he was talking about. Marvin&#8217;s only thought was taking the gun or
  backing out the restaurant. The white man in the dirty T-shirt
  continued to talk about Niggras and there was one living next door who
  he gave watermelon to. While he continued to talk Marvin had eased off
  the stool and began backing across the floor and up the slight ramp to
  the door, he reached behind him, felt the doorknob as the heavyset man
  continued to talk. Once outside on the sidewalk away from the firmly
  closed in front of him; he glanced to his right to the little voices he
  heard coming from under huge evergreen tree. There playing in the dirt
  were two young brown skinned children with blue eyes and ginger hair. I
  thought instantly of the parish of St. George back home on the island.
  That was the Bermudian teen&#8217;s first hand southern experience, welcome
  to North Carolina.</p>


  <p>The next four years at Shaw University in Raleigh North Carolina,
  Marvin&#8217;s life changed forever. Not only was he profoundly awakened to
  his identity as a black person he embraced it wholeheartedly. Over the
  period he would experience other such incidents, minus the shotgun in
  the face except, one it would be poignant to note that he arrived in
  1966 during what some might consider the height of the civil rights
  period. He declared his major in psychology and envisioned a leather
  couch somewhat ornate, outlining the diamond shape design and the
  matching comfortable chair. This vision change however when the
  University established a communications department and WSHA- FM, its
  own radio station. A good friend of Marvin&#8217;s, Fraser Foster suggested
  he would be a good radio personality and that he should go up and see
  the director. Marvin changed his major from psychology to
  Communication, Radio TV and Motion Picture, specifically.</p>


  <p>The collaboration between Ohio State University and Shaw resulted in
  radio programming being more reflective of the culture of Ohio State
  possibly, then that of Shaw University, its students and the community
  in which it was located. The station was run by a student staff and
  supervised by professor Czech. Marvin and fellow staff convinced her to
  allow him to have an R&amp;B show and Jazz programming in the schedule.
  This later resulted in Marvelous Marv&#8217;s Music with Soul R&amp;B show
  and added Cold Duck Time, a jazz show. The soul music program soon
  became extremely popular on campus and the nearby community as well as
  greater Raleigh. Marvin was strongly encouraged by professor Elizabeth
  Czech , to study and become a broadcast journalist. Repeatedly urged
  him to become news reader and reporter; he eventually became news
  director.</p>

  <p>This led him to cover the takeover of the Willard straight Hall at
  Cornell University, on which he produced a two week documentary. He
  also interviewed personalities such as<strong> </strong> <strong>James Brown</strong> and <strong>Martha Reeves</strong>
  of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. Marvin was also active in other
  areas on campus and connected with Minister Kenneth X, the Imam of the
  local Nation of Islam community, to invite <strong>Mohammed Ali</strong> to the school for the CUBS Conference.</p>

  <p>He  was also recognized by the administration for his efforts in quelling
  an attempted student take over of the administration building and the
  damaging of newly constructed buildings on campus, such as the new
  Student Union. This was following such similar actions on other college
  campuses around the nation. The Afro wearing dashiki clad Marvin soon
  became aware that the greater community required more conventional
  attire. The internship, which he initiated with WKIX &#8211; AM/FM required a
  suit and tie. He represented the station throughout the city as a
  reporter, covering the City Council meetings, the governor&#8217;s office,
  the police department and other events in the Triangle area. He won the
  best investigative reporter award for the station by producing a
  documentary on the North Carolina Prison system. He was the first
  journalist to be allowed in the prison system to produce a documentary.
