  <h1>An Island boy comes to the spacious land of America</h1>
  <p>At 14 years of age Marvin encountered a whole new way of life, in a country with unimaginably wide roads, big cars with
    wings; many with four headlights. These cars and trucks were longer than he had ever seen and would speed on highways
    that seemingly went on forever. The strangeness of America became an exciting challenge for the young teen. Pine Forge
    Academy became not only his new high school but his home away from home for the next five years. He explored the rivers
    and the Allegheny Mountains during many weekends. Clad in boots, hunting socks, shorts and the machete he found on campus
    he hiked the mountains and swam in the Manatawny for hours at a time. Unbeknownst to him he was being conditioned, growing
    in strength constantly. The asthma that had plagued him for most of his life became less prominent. He became so adept
    at his new life that the Bermudian would cut a hole in the ice covered Manatawny River which bordered the campus and
    jump in.</p>
  <h1>He nearly dies in search of Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches</h1>

  <p>One particular incident that punctuated his adventurousness was when he and two of his buddies borrowed the school’s canoe
    in the spring one year when the ice began to break on the river and paddled five miles to nearby Pottstown, Pennsylvania.
    Pine Forge Academy was vegetarian, and Marvin and his friends were on a buying trip; they wanted Philly cheese-steak
    sandwiches. The young teens didn’t realize however that the rushing waters that took them on a incredible ride into town
    amid the broken slabs and chunks of ice, would be nearly impossible to negotiate back to campus. The rushing waters and
    enormous slabs of ice were perilous to them. In their attempt to pull the canoe onto a wide piece of ice, it capsized.
    Weighted down with several foot-long Marvin A Brock Sr. Pine Forge Academy... cheese-steak sandwiches tucked in his lumber
    jacket, the frigid waters and silt at the bottom of the raging river almost claimed his life. With only moments of breath
    left to him under water, Marvin was forced to abandon his galoshes stuck in the mud at the bottom of the river— and much
    to his dismay, his lumberjack and his Philly cheese-steaks were lost in the river current. The Bermudian youngster managed
    to swim underwater to the riverbanks where he crawled to the surface to see the roadside lined with people. His fellow
    adventurers were across the street safe in a nearby automobile garage. He was the last one to surface. The school sent
    an open pickup truck to collect the boys. Wrapped in blankets, they rode the five freezing miles back to school in the
    open bed of the pickup. For those five miles, Marvin mused at which conditions were worse, the icy waters of the river
    or the frigid cold and wind of the back of the truck.</p>

    <p>Graduating from Pine Forge Academy</p>
  </div>
<p>Pine Forge Academy, all though a coeducational Seventh-day Adventist boarding school, had a strict code of conduct and boys
  and girls were closely monitored. Later in life Marvin associated that lifestyle to a monastery. This all later became
  clear to him that these were building blocks of life for him. Graduating from Pine Forge Academy The school became an enormous
  learning experience for the island teen; while there he obtained his driver’s license at age 16, joined the maintenance
  staff at school, all the while he also did work-study in the cafeteria. At one point he took over the management of the
  cafeteria for just under six weeks while the cafeteria matron underwent and recovered from surgery. Not only did he have
  to maintain his school work, attend class and study, he also had to prepare three meals a day for students and staff numbering
  over 400. During meetings with the controller, they developed a friendship and Marvin would walk to and from Pottstown
  on weekends with the former Army Captain. He and Capt. Walker, as he was referred to, routinely made the brisk walks, there
  and back. Initially Marvin recalls losing sight of the captain around bends on the road. In his mind Marvin would say to
  himself, no wonder they call him Capt. Walker, referring to his ability to walk so fast. The captain stood over six feet
  tall and there was a striking difference between the two as Marvin stood around 5 foot seven. Over time the teen was able
  to walk side-by-side with his mentor, even as the pace increased. Much was learned by the teen from a 21 square mile island
  of 60,000 people, during his initial five years in America. As Marvin’s high school experience drew to an end, he wanted
  to follow in the footsteps of some of his schoolmates and join the Army to become a Green Beret or join the famed screaming
  Eagles of the 101st Airborne Division. However his father made a deal with him. He wanted all of his children to graduate
  from college; so he bargained with his son that if he could get him admitted into college in the next week, that Marvin
  would abandon his plans for the Military. He was soon on a bus to Shaw University in Raleigh North Carolina where the next
  four years were transformative.</p></section>
