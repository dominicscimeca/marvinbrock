    <h1>An Island boy comes to the spacious land of America</h1>
    <p>At 14 years of age Marvin encountered a whole new way of life, in a country with unimaginably wide roads, big
        cars with
        wings; many with four headlights. These cars and trucks were longer than he had ever seen and would speed on
        highways
        that seemingly went on forever. The strangeness of America became an exciting challenge for the young teen. Pine
        Forge
        Academy became not only his new high school but his home away from home for the next five years. He explored the
        rivers
        and the Allegheny Mountains during many weekends. Clad in boots, hunting socks, shorts and the machete he found
        on campus
        he hiked the mountains and swam in the Manatawny for hours at a time. Unbeknownst to him he was being
        conditioned, growing
        in strength constantly. The asthma that had plagued him for most of his life became less prominent. He became so
        adept
        at his new life that the Bermudian would cut a hole in the ice covered Manatawny River which bordered the campus
        and
        jump in.</p>

    <p>One particular incident that punctuated his adventurousness was when he and two of his buddies borrowed the
        school’s canoe
        in the spring one year when the ice began to break on the river and paddled five miles to nearby Pottstown,
        Pennsylvania.
        Pine Forge Academy was vegetarian, and Marvin and his friends were on a buying trip; they wanted Philly
        cheese-steak
        sandwiches. The young teens didn’t realize however that the rushing waters that took them on a incredible ride
        into town
        amid the broken slabs and chunks of ice, would be nearly impossible to negotiate back to campus. The rushing
        waters and
        enormous slabs of ice were perilous to them. In their attempt to pull the canoe onto a wide piece of ice, it
        capsized.
        Weighted down with several foot-long Marvin A Brock Sr. Pine Forge Academy... cheese-steak sandwiches tucked in
        his lumber
        jacket, the frigid waters and silt at the bottom of the raging river almost claimed his life. With only moments
        of breath
        left to him under water, Marvin was forced to abandon his galoshes stuck in the mud at the bottom of the river—
        and much
        to his dismay, his lumberjack and his Philly cheese-steaks were lost in the river current. The Bermudian
        youngster managed
        to swim underwater to the riverbanks where he crawled to the surface to see the roadside lined with people. His
        fellow
        adventurers were across the street safe in a nearby automobile garage. He was the last one to surface. The
        school sent
        an open pickup truck to collect the boys. Wrapped in blankets, they rode the five freezing miles back to school
        in the
        open bed of the pickup. For those five miles, Marvin mused at which conditions were worse, the icy waters of the
        river
        or the frigid cold and wind of the back of the truck.</p>

        <p>Graduating from Pine Forge Academy</p>
    </div>
    <p>Pine Forge Academy, all though a coeducational Seventh-day Adventist boarding school, had a strict code of
        conduct and boys
        and girls were closely monitored. Later in life Marvin associated that lifestyle to a monastery. This all later
        became
        clear to him that these were building blocks of life for him. Graduating from Pine Forge Academy The school
        became an enormous
        learning experience for the island teen; while there he obtained his driver’s license at age 16, joined the
        maintenance
        staff at school, all the while he also did work-study in the cafeteria. At one point he took over the management
        of the
        cafeteria for just under six weeks while the cafeteria matron underwent and recovered from surgery. Not only did
        he have
        to maintain his school work, attend class and study, he also had to prepare three meals a day for students and
        staff numbering
        over 400. During meetings with the controller, they developed a friendship and Marvin would walk to and from
        Pottstown
        on weekends with the former Army Captain. He and Capt. Walker, as he was referred to, routinely made the brisk
        walks, there
        and back. Initially Marvin recalls losing sight of the captain around bends on the road. In his mind Marvin
        would say to
        himself, no wonder they call him Capt. Walker, referring to his ability to walk so fast. The captain stood over
        six feet
        tall and there was a striking difference between the two as Marvin stood around 5 foot seven. Over time the teen
        was able
        to walk side-by-side with his mentor, even as the pace increased. Much was learned by the teen from a 21 square
        mile island
        of 60,000 people, during his initial five years in America. As Marvin’s high school experience drew to an end,
        he wanted
        to follow in the footsteps of some of his schoolmates and join the Army to become a Green Beret or join the
        famed screaming
        Eagles of the 101st Airborne Division. However his father made a deal with him. He wanted all of his children to
        graduate
        from college; so he bargained with his son that if he could get him admitted into college in the next week, that
        Marvin
        would abandon his plans for the Military. He was soon on a bus to Shaw University in Raleigh North Carolina
        where the next
        four years were transformative.</p>
