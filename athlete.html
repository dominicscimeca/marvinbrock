    <p>While spending many days on one of the islands most popular beaches he met old friends from childhood and began
        running and swimming. At first he ran just a little along the wet sand of the surf. Over time he became friends
        with athletes such as Raymond Swan one of Bermuda’s premier marathoners. Gradually he increased his distances on
        the hard sand along the surf. He slowly move up to the drier deeper sand and onto the dunes. He swam following
        the runs and the distances increased both on the sand and in the water. He was running two and a half miles on
        Horseshoe Beach to the end of Long Beach and back. He also lapped the bay four or five times.

        This coupled with Martial Arts training in the dojo three times a week, developed a level of fitness that he had
        never known. He was joined on nine to twelve mile runs with friends and cousins but the nineteen and twenty mile
        runs were often alone. He bought a racing bike and added cycling to his regiment and soon cycled to the pool at
        sunrise for a swim, cycled to the office only a few blocks away, spent lunch in the gym weight training with
        Cliff Lobby an old friend from his days body building in his late teens.</p>


    <p>Late afternoon before the traffic of people leaving work he would alternate cycling to the Bermuda Arts and
        Fitness Karate dojo or go for a twenty five or fifty mile ride. The days that he trained in the Uechi-Ryu dojo
        he could often be seen running five miles home pushing his bike, either by the handles or the seat. Brock became
        extremely fit and couldn’t understand why an office administrator on the fourth floor, the same floor as his
        office could beat him up the eight flights of stairs. They often encountered each other on the first floor and
        being a gentleman he insisted she go first, she would hike up the front of her long flowing dress and the race
        was on. She would take two to three steps at a time. He soon realized that she was the new administrator of one
        of his clients business. </p>

    <p>He along with most other Black Bermudians did not date white women but as Marvin had recently become a member of
        the Baha’i Faith he had to look at himself in the transformation process he was undergoing and found he was not
        adhering to the principle of the Faith that required him to eliminate prejudice of all kinds in his daily life.
        It was then he realized he did not dated white women. It took a lot of courage but slowly he did and when he
        realized he was attracted to this administrator who could beat him running the stairs he eventually asked he out
        to dinner. She had a daughter from her previous marriage and he had a son. The two married and blended Black and
        White into an unusual family on the island in the early eighties. It caused quite a stir he would later learn
        when as terms that it was not appreciated or liked.</p>
